# Crucial 2 - public server version
This is a fork of the official [Crucial 2](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/crucial2) modpack by [Violet Moon](https://github.com/VazkiiMods).  

The goal of this fork is to make the pack suitable for public servers by adding mods like [FTBChunks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-chunks-forge), allowing players to protect their building from grieving.  

If you want to get more information about the Crucial 2 modpack itself, please go to the [official pack site](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/crucial-2).
